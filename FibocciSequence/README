## Fibonacci

The program reads an image file and uses it for a template. To read the image file it uses BufferedImage.
When the program reads the image, it sets the dimensions depending on how many lines will follow; it creates a black rectangle, which will perfectly fit all the lines that will be written. Each line represents i-th Fibonacci number; The height of the image changes by adding 32 * (M - N + 1)
(32 is the required space between each line)

After that, using a method I've created, it will 
directly add the i-th Fibonacci number to the photo. 

Then, it saves the photo by submitting the new version, the type of it and the destination (where it should be saved).

To run the program you only need to put 
the correct paths instead of "Some Path" 
in Engine Class (14,15 row) - where to get the photo from and where to save it.
