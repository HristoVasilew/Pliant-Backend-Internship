## Fibonacci

The program reads an image file and uses it for a template. To read the image file the program then uses BufferedImage.
After the  image is read, the program sets the dimensions depending on how many lines will follow; the program creates a black rectangle,
which will perfectly fit all the lines that will be written. Each line represents i-th Fibonacci number.
If necessary the height of the image changes by adding 32 * (M - N + 1) (32 is the required space between each line)

After that, using a method I've created, it will directly add the i-th Fibonacci number to the photo. 

Then, the program saves the photo by submitting the new version, the type and the destination (where it should be saved).

To run the program you only need to put the correct paths instead of "Some Path" 
in Engine Class (14,15 row) - where to get the photo from and where to save it.
